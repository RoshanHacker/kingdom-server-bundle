## Installation

### Install the package via composer

Add the repository to composer.json after creating a new symfony 3.* project

```yaml
    "repositories" : [{
        "type" : "vcs",
        "url" : "https://github.com/7thcubic/kingdom-server-bundle"
    }],
```
```
composer require kori\kingdom-server-bundle 
```
### Add the package to the kernel
```php
   $bundles = [
        new Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\FrameworkBundle(),
        ...
        new Kori\KingdomServerBundle\KoriKingdomServerBundle()
   ];
```

### Configure the server
```yaml
kori_kingdom_server:
    servers:
      my_server:
        domain: game.domain.com
        db_connection: "@doctrine.orm.default_entity_manager" # Provide a different entity manager for each instance
        rate: 1 # Server speed
        days_of_protection: 7 # Protection period
        
```

### Set up the server

Run the following command to set up the server.

```
php bin/console kingdom:setup

# Example 
php bin/console kingdom:setup -g CustomWorld -g NPC
```

Optional Parameters:
* --override/-o: Overrides the current world and run set up again
* --generator/-g: Generators to use
* --ignore_restrictions/-ignore: Ignores the generator requirements

> Note: There is a strict requirement of providing a world, race, building, technology and units generator.

### Creating custom generators

* All generators must implement the GeneratorInterface. 
* There are no restrictions on types.
* Generators runs from smallest to largest, 0 -> ...
* Existing types are:
  * World: 0
  * Race: 1
  * Building: 2
  * Technology: 3
  * Units: 4
  * NPC: 5
  * Quest: 6
  * Consumables: 7

## Rules

Rule systems are required for logic handling, it allows for expending of current rule set.

### Assigning rules

If no rules are defined for the server, the default rule set would be used.

While there can be multiple build rule set, there can only be 1 attack rule per server.

```yaml
kori_kingdom_server:
    default_rules:
      build: [basic, additional1, ... ]
      attack: standard
```

To define rules to use for a particular server

```yaml
kori_kingdom_server:
    servers:
      my_server:
       ...
       build: [basic]
       attack: weakbuilding
```

### Creating Rules

You may create and assign different rule set to the different servers.

#### Build Rules

Build rule is used to process and validate a valid build request.

To register a build rule add the tag name "kori_kingdom.build_rule" to the service

```yaml
# Example
services:
  Kori\KingdomServerBundle\Rules\Build\:
    resource: '../../Rules/Build/*'
    tags:
      - { name: kori_kingdom.build_rule }
```

> All Build rules must implement the BuildRuleInterface

#### Attack Rule

Attack rule is used to process the result of a fight between two towns.

To register an attack rule add the tag name "kori_kingdom.attack_rule" to the service

```yaml
services:
  Kori\KingdomServerBundle\Rules\Attack\:
    resource: '../../Rules/Attack/*'
    tags:
      - { name: kori_kingdom.attack_rule }
```

> All attack rule must implement the AttackRuleInterface

#### Effect Rule

Effect rule is used to process the effects of consuming an item.

To register an attack rule add the tag name "kori_kingdom.effect_rule" to the service

```yaml
# Example
services:
  Kori\KingdomServerBundle\Rules\Effects\:
    resource: '../../Rules/Effects/*'
    tags:
      - { name: kori_kingdom.effect_rule }
```

> All effect rule must implement the EffectRuleInterface


### Events/Activity

Load the standard activities by adding the following to the services.yml

```yaml
imports:
    - { resource: "@KoriKingdomServerBundle/Resources/config/activity.yml" }
```

To register an activity add the tag name "kori_kingdom.activity" to the service

```yaml
#Example
services:
  Kori\KingdomServerBundle\Activity\Standard\:
    resource: '../../Activity/Standard/*'
    tags:
      - { name: kori_kingdom.activity }
```

> All activity must extend Activity

To set a repeating event, set repeatable to true and schedule to the time interval.

Example:

| Repeatable | Schedule  | Result                                        |
|:----------:|:---------:| --------------------------------------------- |
| Yes        | 10        | Run every 10 seconds                          |
| No         | 5000      | Run after 5000 seconds the server is created  |
